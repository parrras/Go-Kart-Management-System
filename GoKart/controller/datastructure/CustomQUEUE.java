 * operations like enqueue, dequeue, peek, and size checks</b>.
 *
 * <p>
 * Features include:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Capacity limit for the queue.</li>
 * <li>Ability to check if the queue is empty or full.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note: This implementation assumes that the queue operations are not accessed
 * concurrently.</p>
